I am a AI Scientist at [Paige AI](https://paige.ai/). I did my Ph.D. with [Jennifer Dy](http://www.ece.neu.edu/people/dy-jennifer), [Dana Brooks](http://www.ece.neu.edu/people/brooks-dana), and [Jan-Willem van de Meent](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jwvdm/) at Northeastern University. My main research interests are machine learning with emphasis on probabilistic programming, deep neural networks, and their applications in biomedical image processing. I am one of the developers of [Probabilistic Torch](https://github.com/probtorch/probtorch), a library for deep generative models that extends PyTorch. I am also one of the maintainers of the Pytorch distributions module.
